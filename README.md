Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dave (he/him), a Front End Developer based in Toronto and available for hire! ðŸš€

I've recently completed Juno College's Web Development Immersive Bootcamp and I'm currently continuing to build on my experience with React through fun personal projects. I'm always looking to connect with others about coding, tacos, music, or just to say hi - so say hi!
