Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dave (he/him), a Front End Developer based in Toronto and available for hire! ðŸš€

I've recently completed Juno College's Web Development Immersive Bootcamp and I'm currently continuing to further my experience with React by building some fun projects you can see below, and I'm working on learning Typescript through self-guided courses. I'm always looking to connect with others about coding, tacos, music, or just to say hi - so say hi!
