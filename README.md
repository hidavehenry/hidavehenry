Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dave (he/him), a Front End Developer based in Toronto and available for hire! ðŸš€

I've recently completed Juno College's Web Development Immersive Bootcamp and I'm currently continuing to build on my experience with React by building some fun projects and starting to learn next.js through self-guided learning. I'm always looking to connect with others about coding, tacos, music, or just to say hi - so say hi!
